VibePoint is a simple, powerful tool that helps you understand and shape your emotional state.

Instead of guessing what you feel, VibePoint breaks your emotions into the three ingredients that create them:

- **What you focus on**  
- **What you tell yourself**  
- **What you feel in your body**

By separating these elements, you gain clarity, awareness, and control.

Track your mood on a visual gradient map, reflect on your three ingredients, and unlock personalized insights that reveal your emotional patterns over time.
