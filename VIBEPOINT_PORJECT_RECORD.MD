# Vibepoint — Cursor Project Record (as of 25 Nov 2025)

## Official Product Name
Vibepoint – Your Personal Mood Operating System

## Tagline (current)
The mood map that teaches you how to feel exactly how you want.

## Domain
https://vibepoint.app

## Core Philosophy
Every mood is created by three controllable inputs:
1. What you focus on  
2. What you tell yourself  
3. What your body is doing

→ Stage 1 (Free): Awareness of these three  
→ Stage 2 (Pro): Deliberate direction of these three (“motion creates emotion”)

## Exact Question Wording

### Free version (current & forever)
1. What are you focusing on right now?  
2. What are you telling yourself?  
3. **What sensations are you feeling in your body right now?**

### Pro version – Acting Coach (launching Q1 2026)
The third question upgrades to:  
**“How are you holding and moving your body right now?”**  
(posture, breathing, facial expression, tension, movement, etc.)

This is the pivotal shift from passive awareness → active creation.

## Key Files in Repo

- `project instructions.md.rtf` – full spec
- `readme.md.rtf` – original Next.js boilerplate (replace with above)
- `public/gradient-reference.png` – visual reference

This document is the single source of truth for product direction.  
Any future copy, code, or design decisions must stay aligned with the two-stage pedagogy:
1. Free = sensation awareness  
2. Pro = deliberate motion that creates emotion
