# VibePoint — App Store Description



## Short

VibePoint helps you master your emotional state by breaking feelings into three controllable ingredients — focus, self-talk, and physiology. Clarity → Choice → Power.

## Long

Most mood apps ask you to label your feelings.  

VibePoint shows you **why** they happen and how to change them.



Your emotional state begins with your **focus**:  

whatever your mind is paying attention to in the moment.



Inside your focus, you may notice mental images or imagined scenarios —  

but not everyone sees pictures in their mind.  

That's why VibePoint asks the universal question:



> **What is your mind focused on right now?**  

> *(If any images or scenarios appear, include those too.)*



Along with focus, emotions are shaped by:



- **Self-talk** — the words and tone used internally  

- **Physiology** — breathing, posture, and body signals  



When you separate the ingredients, you gain the power to shift your emotional state intentionally.



VibePoint is not a mood diary.  

It's a state-mastery system.



Stop tracking moods.  

Start understanding them.
