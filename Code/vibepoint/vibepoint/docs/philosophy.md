# The VibePoint Philosophy



Most apps ask you to label how you feel.  

VibePoint helps you understand why you feel it.



You don't need to track emotional labels —  

you need to reveal emotional patterns.



Every emotion has three ingredients:



- **Your focus** (what your mind is locked onto)  

- **Your self-talk**  

- **Your physiology**  



Inside your focus may be imagery or mental scenarios —  

but not everyone identifies as a "visual thinker,"  

so we start with the universal question:



> **What is your mind focused on right now?**  

> *(If you notice any images or scenarios, include those too.)*



VibePoint is not a mood diary.  

It's a clarity tool.  

A state-mastery system.  

A pattern detector.  

A training partner for emotional strength.



We believe emotional mastery is available to anyone who learns the ingredients behind their state.
