## Project Overview
Vibepoint is a mood mapping application that teaches users to understand and control their emotional states by tracking the mental patterns that create their moods. The app uses an intuitive gradient interface where users plot their current mood, then answer reflective questions to build awareness of the thoughts, focus, and physical sensations driving their emotions.

## Core Concept
The app operates on the principle that moods are created by controllable internal factors (what we focus on, what we tell ourselves, physical sensations) rather than external circumstances. By tracking these patterns over time, users learn to recognize and adjust the mental habits that shape their emotional experience.

## Visual Interface

### Gradient Screen
- **Vertical Axis**: Happy (top) to Unhappy (bottom)
- **Horizontal Axis**: Unmotivated (left) to Motivated (right)
- **Interaction**: User taps/clicks on the gradient to select the point that best represents their current mood
- **Visual**: Smooth color gradient transitioning through the mood spectrum

### Color Mapping
- Top-right (happy + motivated): Bright, energetic colors (yellows, oranges)
- Top-left (happy + unmotivated): Calm, content colors (light blues, soft yellows)
- Bottom-right (unhappy + motivated): Tense, driven colors (deep purples, burgundy)
- Bottom-left (unhappy + unmotivated): Low-energy colors (dark blues, deep purples)

## User Flow

### 1. Mood Selection
- User opens app
- Presented with full-screen gradient
- Taps location that matches current mood
- Mood coordinates are recorded (x: motivation level, y: happiness level)

### 2. Reflective Questions
After mood selection, user answers three core questions:

**Question 1: What are you focusing on?**
- What thoughts, situations, or concerns have your attention?
- Examples: "my upcoming deadline", "argument with partner", "vacation plans"
- Allow free-text entry
- Optional: Suggest common categories (work, relationships, health, future, past, etc.)

**Question 2: What are you telling yourself?**
- What internal dialogue or self-talk is running?
- Examples: "I can't handle this", "Everything will work out", "I'm not good enough"
- Free-text entry
- This captures the narrative/interpretation layer

**Question 3: What physical sensations are you experiencing?**
- What do you notice in your body?
- Examples: "tight chest", "relaxed shoulders", "butterflies in stomach", "energized"
- Free-text or checkbox options
- Common sensations: tension, relaxation, energy, fatigue, restlessness, calm, pain, lightness

### 3. Save & Confirm
- Brief confirmation message
- Option to add notes
- Timestamp recorded
- Return to home screen

## Data Tracking & Analysis

### Data Points Per Entry
- Timestamp
- Mood coordinates (x, y)
- Focus content (text)
- Self-talk content (text)
- Physical sensations (text/tags)
- Optional notes

### Pattern Recognition Features

> **Current Implementation:** See [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for the latest pattern insight thresholds and progressive disclosure system.

**Progressive Insight Unlocking:**
- **5 entries:** Show user their mood map (scatter plot of all mood selections on gradient)
- **7 entries:** Early patterns emerging (basic observations)
- **15 entries:** Pattern correlations ("When you focus on [work deadlines], you tend to be in the [bottom-right quadrant]")
- **30+ entries:** Deep insights (multi-variable, predictive patterns)

**Pattern Insights Display:**
- "Your Patterns" dashboard
- Top 5 focus areas and their associated mood ranges
- Most common self-talk phrases and their mood correlations
- Physical sensations that predict mood states
- Visual charts showing these relationships

**Actionable Insights:**
- "Notice: When you focus on 'things you're grateful for', your mood is typically in the top-left (happy, calm) zone"
- "Pattern detected: Telling yourself 'I should be better' correlates with lower happiness scores"
- "Your body knows: 'Tension in shoulders' appears in 80% of your unmotivated entries"

## Key Features

### 1. Quick Entry
- Fast, low-friction mood logging
- Can complete full entry in under 60 seconds
- No overwhelming forms or lengthy questionnaires

### 2. Progressive Insights
- Insights unlock as data accumulates
- Early: Simple mood tracking
- Medium: Pattern identification
- Advanced: Predictive awareness and suggestions

### 3. Mood Literacy Education
- Brief tips explaining how focus, self-talk, and physical state create emotions
- Educational content delivered gradually
- Not preachy—discovery-based learning from user's own data

### 4. Privacy First
- All data stored locally or with end-to-end encryption
- User owns their data
- Optional export functionality
- No social features (this is personal work)

### 5. Entry Throttling System
> **Current Implementation:** See [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for complete entry throttling specification.

- **30-minute minimum buffer** between entries (soft limit)
- Users can override up to **3 times per day** for rapid mood shifts
- Rapid shift entries are tracked separately for pattern analysis
- This ensures data quality while allowing users to log significant mood changes

### 6. Free vs Premium Tiers

## Design Principles
1. **Simplicity**: No clutter, fast interaction
2. **Non-judgmental**: All moods are valid data points
3. **Empowering**: Focus on user agency and control
4. **Private**: Safe space for honest self-reflection
