# VibePoint — Press Kit

## Overview

VibePoint is an emotional mastery system that helps users understand and shift the patterns behind their emotions. Instead of tracking feelings, VibePoint breaks emotions into the three elements that create them: focus, self-talk, and physiology.

## Mission Statement
To give every person the clarity and tools to take control of their emotional state — consistently and intentionally.

## What Makes VibePoint Unique
- Not a mood diary — a state-mastery tool  
- Identifies the *ingredients* behind every emotion  
- Uses pattern recognition, not journaling  
- Fast, simple emotional skill building  
- Designed for clarity, action, and empowerment  

## Key Features
- Emotional Map (Happiness ↑ / Motivation →)  
- State Breakdown (Focus, Self-Talk, Physiology)  
- Pattern Recognition Engine  
- Daily State Reset Exercise  
- Data Privacy: No selling, no sharing, fully private  

## Problem We Solve
Most mood apps reinforce negative identity loops.  
VibePoint helps people change emotional patterns — not record them.

## Audience
- High performers  
- Entrepreneurs  
- Individuals seeking emotional clarity  
- Anyone tired of “tracking” feelings without improvement  

## Vision
A world where emotional mastery is a daily skill — not a mystery.
