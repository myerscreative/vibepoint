# VibePoint — Updated Onboarding Screens



---



## Screen 1  

**Master Your Emotional State.**  

Your emotions follow patterns you can learn to understand and change.



---



## Screen 2  

**Your First Ingredient: Focus**  

Your focus is whatever your mind is locked onto right now.



---



## Screen 3  

**Focus Sometimes Includes Mental Images**  

Memories, imagined scenarios, what-ifs…  

But you don't have to "visualize" to use VibePoint effectively.  

We begin with focus because everyone has it.

## Screen 4  

**Break Down Every State**  

Focus → Self-talk → Physiology  

Separate the ingredients → gain clarity → gain control.



---



## Screen 5  

**Not a Mood Tracker — A State Mastery System**  

You don't just record how you feel.  

You understand why you feel it and how to shift it.

## Screen 6  

**Let's Begin**  

Tap where you are on the map and identify your ingredients.
