# VibePoint – Promo Video Script (Tony Robbins Style)

[Soft music → building confidence]

VOICEOVER:
Most mood apps ask you one question:
“How do you feel?”

But identifying the problem is not the same as changing it.

And replaying the story of a bad day?
That doesn’t create breakthroughs —
it creates patterns you get stuck in.

VibePoint isn’t a log of your emotions.
It’s a blueprint for mastering them.

Every emotion you feel comes from three ingredients:
your focus,
your self-talk,
and your physiology.

Change the ingredients —
change the state.

VibePoint helps you break the pattern,
shift your internal world,
and feel the way you want —
consistently.

Stop tracking moods.
Start mastering them.

VibePoint.
Emotional power made simple.
